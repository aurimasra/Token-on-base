# Project Whitepaper

## Overview
This project introduces a utility-focused token built on the Base network. 
The token is designed to power ecosystem interactions, enable on-chain participation, and create long-term value through real use cases.

## Vision
To build a scalable, transparent, and utility-driven digital asset ecosystem leveraging the speed and low-cost infrastructure of Base.

## Core Utility
The token will serve as:
- Access token for ecosystem features
- Reward and incentive distribution mechanism
- Governance participation tool (future implementation)
- Integration asset for DeFi and on-chain applications

## Token Model
- Fixed / controlled supply mechanism
- Transparent smart contract logic
- On-chain verifiable distribution

## Security
All contracts are deployed on Base and designed with security and transparency as core principles.

## Roadmap
Phase 1 – Smart contract deployment  
Phase 2 – Utility integration  
Phase 3 – Staking and ecosystem expansion  
Phase 4 – Governance and community growth  

## Network
Base Mainnet
